+Hello

These are music players I worked painstakingly hard on.
Originally I wanted a player for my own use..
But then I got carried away in making designs.
They aren't perfect, for example the api simply isn't working.
Yes, the frequency bars section is just decoration.
It was meant to mimic winamp as a coded project.
Anyone who can figure out the api is encouraged to do so, and hey the design is already done for you.
I intended to create more but it took so long to perfect them I am satisfied with the collection.
If the files are on your computer it works offline.
To use online you must source the audio from somewhere.
Rememeber every single part of these are customizeable!!
Change the fonts, colors, size, features, images, music files, script however you wish~

{ If I ever figure out the broken sections then I'll update them }
